**Additional note re. CYP data on 15th Feb 2025**: **TL;DR: It may be good to add another layer of data complexity (e.g. The Flockhart Cytochrome P450 Drug-Drug Interaction Table) to better reflect real-life drug effects in human uses**. A small discovery re. CYP data used in many ADMET prediction apps - most of them seem to be using *in vitro*-based data (a few other ones use PubChem, which can vary too from different sources e.g. journal papers or from drugbank etc.). I think if the Flockhart table can be added at the same time (to include *in-vivo* evidence in humans, although as I look through some of the citations for drugs in the table, it is also true that not all of them have *in-vivo* human-use evidence, however it should have a decent number of them in it). Overall, this may make ADMET research more well-covered and may improve data quality even more. Another thing is Flockhart table differentiates drugs with strong clinical evidence from the moderate ones, and also other ones pending reviews - this is something *in-vitro* data won't provide.

Here are the notes regarding the strong and moderate CYP3A4 substrates used in the data in the [accompanying notebook](https://jhylin.github.io/Data_in_life_blog/posts/22_Simple_dnn_adrs/2_ADR_regressor.html), and over time, this note will also include drug information for other CYP enzyme substrates.

<br>

##### **drug_name and cyp_strength_of_evidence source** 

*note: "cyp_strength_of_evidence source" column may be renamed as "cyp_type_and_cyp_strength_of_evidence" when other CYP isoform substrates are added*

This is all based on the Flockhart table of drug interactions: [https://drug-interactions.medicine.iu.edu/MainTable.aspx](https://drug-interactions.medicine.iu.edu/MainTable.aspx)

Strength of evidence that the drug is metabolised by a certain CYP enzyme (as quoted from above web link):

- Strong Evidence (may be denoted with s_ followed by CYP name e.g. s_3A4): the enzyme is majorly responsible for drug metabolism.
- Moderate Evidence (may be denoted with m_ followed by CYP name e.g. m_3A4): the enzyme plays a significant but not exclusive role in drug metabolism or the supporting literature is not extensive.

<br>

##### **drug_class data sources**

This information can be found in many different national drug formularies, drug reference textbooks e.g. Martindale, American society of health-System pharmacists' (ASHP) drug information (DI) monographs,
PubChem, ChEMBL, FDA, Micromedex etc. or online drug resources such as Drugs.com. For the particular small dataset collected and used in the notebook, the following reference sources for ADRs also contain information on therapeutic drug classes.

<br>

##### **ADRs data sources**

* 1st-line: [Drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/sfx/) 
  - using the health professional version for ADRs which usually contains ADR references from pharmaceutical manufacturers' medicines information data sheets, ASHP DI monographs or journal paper references

  - reason for choosing this web data source is that it is open to public (without login registrations or paywalls) and contains the last updated date along with all references used for the ADRs information on each drug

* 2nd-line as separate data checks: 

  - [NZ formulary (nzf)](https://nzf.org.nz/nzf_1) - mainly adapted from the British national formulary (BNF) with drug information tailored to NZ populations, and likely only available to NZ residents only due to licensing restrictions, other national formularies should contain very similar drug information

  - [electronic medicines compendium (emc)](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc) - UK-based drug reference; equivalents of UK/Europe-based pharmaceutical manufacturers' medicines data sheets (note: there may be limited numbers of free access each month, and may require sign ups to access drug information)
 
  - [Drugs@FDA](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf/index.cfm) - US-based drug reference from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US
  
  - [drugs.com_uk_di](https://www.drugs.com/uk/) - UK drug information section in Drugs.com (equivalent to pharmaceutical manufacturers' medicines information data sheets)

  - pharmaceutical manufacturers' medicines information data sheets (referenced as "data_sheet") as stated for each drug with notes

  - reason to include a 2nd-line ADRs source is to ensure that all ADRs recorded in this dataset is clinically relevant in real-life cases (although mainly in clinical trials; but this is where postmarketing reports come into place, and also I'm attempting to use my previous on-site clinical work experience when curating the dataset). It also acts as an information accuracy check from a different, independent, trustworthy drug information source that is often referred to and used by healthcare professionals around the globe

- two main types of occurrences/frequencies used: 

  ^^ - common > 10%, 

  ^ - less common 1% to 10%, 

  (not going to include other ones with lower incidences e.g. less common at 0.1% to 1%, rare for less than 0.1% etc.)

<br>

##### **Exceptions or notes for ADRs**

- all minor ADRs are removed as the current focus will be more on ADRs that'll affect qualities of lives or are potentially more life-threatening (e.g. chills, flatulence and abdominal discomforts are removed if there are already abdominal pains present)

- nausea and vomiting applies to many drugs so won't be included (almost every drug will have these ADRs, they can be alleviated with electrolytes replacements and anti-nausea meds or other non-med options; rash on the other hand can sometimes be serious and life-threatening e.g. Stevens-Johnson syndrome)

- similar or overlapping adverse effects will be removed to keep only one adverse effect for the same drug e.g. adverse skin reactions, rash, urticaria - rash and urticaria will be removed as allergic skin reactions encompass both symptoms

- for ADR terms with similar meanings, e.g. pyrexia/fever - fever is used instead (only one will be used); attempts have been made to use just one ADR term to represent various other similar-meaning ADRs to minimise duplications

---

- ADR mentioned in common ADR category and repeated in the less common one will have the ADR recorded in the higher incidence rate (at > 10%) only

- some ADRs can be dose-related or formulations-related e.g. injection site irritations or allergic reactions caused by excipients/fillers (aim is to investigate the relationships between ADRs and drugs via computational tools e.g. any patterns between ADRs & drugs so dose/formulations-related ADRS will not be recorded here); all ADRs recorded in the dataset are currently not formulation-specific (e.g. not differentiated between oral, suspensions/liquids, subcutaneous, intravenous or intramuscular injections or topical formulations - they're all grouped together for now) 

- Some of the ADRs recorded for some of the drugs may apply to younger or pediatrics populations - this may need to be taken care of when using these data to build machine learning models, specific drug notes with astericks in the dataset should be in place as reminders, otherwise most of the ADRs in the datset should be mainly applicable to adult populations

---

- some postmarketing adverse effects are for different age populations e.g. paediatric patients of up to 12 years of age or elderly people - for now all of them are labelled as "(pm)" to denote postmarketing reports and are not differentiated in age groups

- postmarketing reports are limited to the experiences of certain unknown population sizes using the specific medicines, therefore it is not possible to directly extrapolate the frequencies of these reports, and also not possible to confirm a direct causal relationship between the drug and its postmarketing reports (a potential downside of the ADRs data, but with more reporting in place, there's a larger possibility to observe common ADRs traits or trends during data analysis which may help future research into their possible causes or mechanisms)

- not all postmarketing reports are included for each drug in the dataset, but only ones that are relevant clinically or mentioned in the 1st-line or in both 1st-line and 2nd-line data sources (the postmarketing ADRs dataset can be expanded further in the future if needed e.g. for investigations on postmarketing ADRs reports only)

---

- one other thing I'd like to mention is that all the ADRs recorded in this repository are not merely a copy-and-paste action from the drug reference sources, they also include or are integrated with the ones I've encountered from my previous pharmacist work experience (in the hope to better reflect bedside or clinical ADRs, and this is also why the data collection part is taking time...)

---

- serotonergic drugs tend to induce serotonin syndrome (e.g. tremor, ataxia, restlestness, shivering, sweating, fever, tachycardia, tachypnoea, confusion, agitation, coma) especially if used in combinations concomitantly (monotherapy tends to have smaller risk) 

- typical ADRs of antipsychotics drugs can include extrapyramidal symptoms (parkinsonian symptoms e.g. tremors, dystonias or dyskinesia (abnormal muscular spasms), akathisia (restlessness) and tardive dyskinesia (most significant antipsychotic ADR causing abnormal involuntary movements of face, jaw and tongue; common in first generation antipsychotics)), constipation, sexual dysfunction, cardiovascular adverse effects, hyperglycaemia, problem with body temperature regulations and neuroleptic malignant syndrome (usually rare but potentially can be fatal)

---

- several ADR terms related to lack of physical energy e.g. fatigue, malaise, lethary or asthenia may be repetitive in the datasets (in process to use one ADR term only; *currently keeping two terms: malaise, fatigue* **to be checked in the end**)

<br>

###### **Notes for specific drugs**

- hydrocortisone (a moderate CYP3A4 substrate) has no reported ADR frequencies at all for its ADRs as they are entirely dependent on the dosage and duration of use (ADRs tend to be unnoticeable at appropriate low doses for short durations)

- terfenadine (a strong CYP3A4 substrate) is actually withdrawn from the market in 1990s due to QT prolongations

- lercanidipine (a moderate CYP3A4 substrate) has nil reported ADRs of more than 1% but has a few postmarketing reports recorded

- telaprevir (a moderate CYP3A4 substrate) is usually administered within a combination therapy (e.g. along with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin)

- quinine (a moderate CYP3A4 substrate) has all of its ADRs reported without frequencies. The most common ADRs are presented as a cluster of symptoms (known as cinchonism) and can occur during overdoses (usually very toxic) and also normal doses. These symptoms include "...tinnitus, hearing impairment, headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, visual disturbances (including blindness), arrhythmias (which can have a very rapid onset), convulsions (which can be intractable), and rashes." (as quoted from NZ formulary v150 - 01 Dec 2024)

- ribociclib (a moderate CYP3A4 substrate) has a listed ADR of on-treatment deaths, which were found to be associated with patients also taking letrozole or fulvestrant at the same time and/or in patients with underlying malignancy

- nortriptyline (a strong CYP2D6 substrate) has no frequencies recorded for all of its ADRs - the recorded ADRs in files will be mainly based on nzf which has stated these ADRs as common ones with varying risk and extent, a good rule of thumb is to be aware of the well-known tricyclic antidepressant-related ADRs e.g. antimuscarinic effects (dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, urinary retention)

- perhexiline (a strong CYP2D6 substrate) has no records of medicines information in Drugs@FDA or Drugs.com so the main source of drug information is nzf and its pharmaceutical manufacturer's [medicines data sheet](https://www.medsafe.govt.nz/profs/datasheet/p/pexsigtab.pdf). The ADRs may be present for the first two to four weeks of treatment only

- escitalopram (a moderate CYP2D6 substrate) is also known to induce selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor-related hyponatraemia (through inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion) when certain risk factors are also present at the same time e.g. diuretic use, female gender, low body weight, geriatric populations along with low baseline sodium level

- lidocaine (a moderate CYP2D6 substrate) doesn't have ADR frequencies recorded - ADRs for amide local anaesthetics apply instead (mainly central nervous and cardiovascular system-related) and toxicity is commonly dose-dependent (e.g. increased risk due to high plasma concentration); hypersensitivity reactions may sometimes be due to preservatives used (e.g. parabens)

- metoclopramide (a moderate CYP2D6 substrate) has ADRs of acute dystonic reaction and extrapyramidal disorders -  more details about extrapyramidal effects [here](https://www.psychdb.com/meds/antipsychotics/eps#extrapyramidal-symptoms-eps) and this [one](https://www.medsafe.govt.nz/profs/PUArticles/March2023/Metoclopramide-risk-dystonic-side-effects-children-and-young-adults.html) about dystonic reactions

- cyclophosphamide (a moderate CYP2C19 substrate) is a cytotoxic drug in the class of aklyating agents. One of its notable ADRs is urothelial toxicity (presented as haemorrhagic cystitis) caused by acrolein (its urinary metabolite via hepatic metabolism). Ways to alleviate this is to increase fluid intake for at least 24 to 48 hours after intravenous injection or use mesna. High dose of cyclophosphamide may also cause cardiotoxicity.

- r-mephobarbital (a strong CYP2C19 substrate), manufactured previously as mephobarbital (also known as methylphenobarbital), is currently not commonly prescribed (discontinued from 2011-12). One of the likely reasons could be due to its metabolism by CYP enzymes to phenobarbital, which is also available as an antiepileptic drug. Other possible reasons are its higher risk from overdose and drug dependency, so often barbiturate-based drug is replaced with other antiepileptics or non-antiepileptics instead depending on indications. Its ADR is based on this medicines data sheet [link](https://www.drugs.com/pro/mephobarbital.html) from its last pharmaceutical manufacturer (Lundbeck Inc.)

- flurbiprofen (a moderate CYP2C9 substrate) is one of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs which are well-known to be associated with cardiovascular, gastrointestinal (cyclo-oxygenase-2 selective inhibitors may have lower risk) and renal-related risks, therefore most of the ADRs recorded, including postmarketing reports, will focus on these physiological influences mainly

- glimepiride (a moderate CYP2C9 substrate) is one of the sulfonylureas used for blood glucose control in type-2 diabetics. One of its postmarketing reports of "disulfiram-like reaction" is about the unpleasant effects (e.g. facial flushing, headache, palpitations, tachycardia) experienced after alcohol consumption (note: disulfiram is another drug often used for treating alcohol dependence)

- glyburide (a moderate CYP2C9 substrate) is also known as glibenclamide in some of the countries around the world

- phenytoin (a moderate CYP2C9 substrate) may cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR), e.g. drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, and acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis, which may require closer monitoring and drug discontinuation if required. Its occurrence is more likely in a genetic population with a particular human leukocyte antigen (HLA) allele present e.g. HLA-B^*15:02

- warfarin (a moderate CYP2C9 substrate) doesn't have any ADR frequencies recorded as it's a well-known vitamin K antagonist, often used as an oral anticoagulant, with a prominent ADR of causing fatal or non-fatal organ or tissue haemorrhage. The best strategy to prevent any haemorrhagic events is to monitor via international normalised ratio (INR) testing

- caffeine (a strong CYP1A2 substrate) is normally quite well tolerated orally; the ADRs recorded in the dataset here is mostly based on caffeine citrate 20mg/mL injection, which is often used in premature infants and may not be applicable to other populations

- clozpine (a strong CYP1A2 substrate) is one of the second generation or atypical antipsychotics with many ADRs requiring close monitoring e.g. frequencies of bowel motions (contipation is one of the common ADRs that is potentially fatal), white cell counts and cardiac toxicity-related symptoms and/or cardiovascular-related lab marker changes; people with pre-existing diabetes or liver diseases are also prone to ADRs related to these diseases while on clozapine

- melatonin (a strong CYP1A2 substrate) has no ADRs with frequencies above 10% as it's normally quite well tolerated at appropriate dose for short-term use (e.g. 3 months)
