Notes regarding the strong and moderate CYP3A4 substrates datasets.

At the moment, another likely change to the datasets will be removing the "^^" and "^" as they may not be needed, depending on what I'm going to do with EDA and later possible DL work.

###### drug_name and cyp_strength_of_evidence source: 

[https://drug-interactions.medicine.iu.edu/MainTable.aspx](https://drug-interactions.medicine.iu.edu/MainTable.aspx)

Strength of evidence that the drug is metabolised by CYP3A4/5:

- Strong Evidence: the enzyme is majorly responsible for drug metabolism.
- Moderate Evidence: the enzyme plays a significant but not exclusive role in drug metabolism or 
the supporting literature is not extensive.

###### drug_class data sources: 

Many national drug formularies, drug reference textbooks e.g. Martindale, 
American society of health-System pharmacists' (ASHP) drug information (DI) monographs,
PubChem, ChEMBL, FDA, Micromedex etc. or online drug resources such as Drugs.com

###### adverse_effects data sources: 

* 1st-line: [Drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/sfx/) - using the health professional version for ADRs and it usually contains ADR references from pharmaceutical manufacturers' medicines information data sheets, ASHP DI monographs or journal paper references

* 2nd-line as separate data checks: 

  [NZ formulary (nzf)](https://nzf.org.nz/nzf_1) - likely only available to NZ residents only; other national formularies should contain very similar drug information

  [electronic medicines compendium (emc)](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc) - UK-based drug reference

  [Drugs@FDA](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf/index.cfm) - US-based drug reference
  
  [drugs.com_uk_di](https://www.drugs.com/uk/) - UK drug information section in Drugs.com (equivalent to pharmaceutical manufacturers' medicine information data sheets)

- two main occurrences in percentages: 

  ^^ - common > 10%, 

  ^ - less common 1% to 10%, 

  (not going to include other ones with lower incidences e.g. less common 0.1% to 1%, rare less than 0.1% etc.)

###### Exceptions for adverse_effects: 

- nausea & vomiting applies to many drugs so won't be included 
- similar or overlapping adverse effects will be removed to keep only one adverse effect for the same drug e.g. adverse skin reactions, rash, urticaria - rash and urticaria will be removed as allergic skin reactions encompass both symptoms
- ADR mentioned in common ADR category and repeated in the less common one will have the ADR recorded in the higher incidence rate (at > 10%) only
- some ADRs can be dose-related or formulations-related e.g. injection site irritations or allergic reactions caused by excipients/fillers (aim is to investigate the relationships between ADRs and drugs via computational tools e.g. any patterns between ADRs & drugs so dose/formulations-related ADRS will not be recorded/compiled here)
- some postmarketing adverse effects are for different age populations e.g. paediatric patients of up to 12 years of age or elderly people - for now all of them are labelled as "(pm)" to denote postmarketing reports and are not differentiated in age groups
- specifically for hydrocortisone (a moderate CYP3A4 substrate), there are no reported ADR frequencies at all for its ADRs as the they are entirely dependent on the dosage and duration of use (ADRs tend to be unnoticeable at appropriate low doses for short durations)
- terfenadine (a strong CYP3A4 substrate) is actually withdrawn from the market in 1990s due to QT prolongations
- lercanidipine (a moderate CYP3A4 substrate) has nil reported ADRs of more than 1% but has a few postmarketing reports recorded

###### Abbreviations used:

- MTOR = mammalian target of rapamycin (protein kinase)
- AST = Aspartate transaminase/aminotransferase
- ALT = alanine transaminase/aminotransferase
- ALP = alkaline phosphatase
- GGT = gamma-glutamyltransferase
- RTI = respiratory tract infection
- UTI = urinary tract infection
