CYP3A4/5 substrates

notes (to be moved into post once data collection is finished):

* drug_name and cyp_strength_of_evidence source: 
https://drug-interactions.medicine.iu.edu/MainTable.aspx
Strength of evidence that the drug is metabolised by CYP3A4/5:
Strong Evidence: the enzyme is majorly responsible for drug metabolism.
Moderate Evidence: the enzyme plays a significant but not exclusive role in drug metabolism or 
the supporting literature is not extensive.

* drug_class data sources: 
many national drug formularies, drug reference textbooks e.g. Martindale, 
American society of health-System pharmacists' (ASHP) drug information (DI) monographs,
PubChem, ChEMBL, FDA, Micromedex etc. or online drug resources such as Drugs.com

* adverse_effects data sources: 
pharmaceutical manufacturers' medicines information data sheets, drugs.com (1st-line, using health professional info for adverse drug effects), NZ formulary (nzf), electronic medicines compendium (emc) or Drugs@FDA
(as separate data checks)
- two main occurrences in percentages: 
^^ - common > 10%, 
^ - less common 1% to 10%, 
(not going to include other ones with lower incidences e.g. less common 0.1% to 1%, rare less than 0.1% etc.)

* exceptions for adverse_effects: 
- nausea & vomiting applies to many drugs so won't be included 
- similar or overlapping adverse effects will be removed to keep only one adverse effect for the same drug e.g. adverse skin reactions, rash, urticaria - rash and urticaria will be removed as allergic skin reactions encompass both symptoms
- some ADRs can be dose-related or formulations-related e.g. injection site irritations or allergic reactions caused by excipients/fillers (aim is to investigate the relationships between ADRs and drugs via computational tools e.g. any patterns between ADRs & drugs so dose/formulations-related ADRS will not be recorded/compiled here)
- some postmarketing adverse effects are for different age populations e.g. paediatric patients of up to 12 years of age or elderly people - for now all of them are labelled as "(pm)" to denote postmarketing reports and are not differentiated in age groups

* note: terfenadine - withdrawn from market in 1990s due to QT prolongations

* abbreviations used:
- ws = withdrawal symptoms
- ADH = antidiuretic hormone
- pm = postmarketing reports
- CNS = central nervous system
- CFTR = cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator 
- c_diff = Clostridioides/Clostridium difficile
- ZE = Zollinger-Ellison
- MTOR = mammalian target of rapamycin (protein kinase)
- AST = Aspartate transaminase/aminotransferase
- ALT = alanine transaminase
- ALP = alkaline phosphatase
- GGT = gamma-glutamyltransferase
- RTI = respiratory tract infection
- UTI = urinary tract infection
