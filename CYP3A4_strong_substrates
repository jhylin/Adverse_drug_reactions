CYP3A4/5 substrates

notes:

* drug_name and cyp_strength_of_evidence source: 
https://drug-interactions.medicine.iu.edu/MainTable.aspx
Strength of evidence that the drug is metabolised by CYP3A4/5:
Strong Evidence: the enzyme is majorly responsible for drug metabolism.
Moderate Evidence: the enzyme plays a significant but not exclusive role in drug metabolism or 
the supporting literature is not extensive.

* drug_class data sources: 
many national drug formularies, drug reference textbooks e.g. Martindale, 
American Society of Health-System Pharmacists' (ASHP) DI Monographs,
PubChem, ChEMBL, FDA, Micromedex etc. or online drug resources such as Drugs.com

* adverse_effects data sources: 
pharmaceutical manufacturers' medicines information data sheets, Drugs.com, FDA or NZ formulary 
(as separate data checks)
- two main occurrences in percentages: ^^ - common > 10%, ^ - less common 1% to 10%, 
not going to include other ones with lower incidences e.g. less common 0.1% to 1%, rare less than 0.1% etc. 

* exceptions for adverse_effects: 
- nausea & vomiting applies to many drugs so won't be included 
- similar or overlapping adverse effects will be removed to keep only one e.g. adverse skin reactions, 
rash, urticaria - rash and urticaria will be removed as allergic skin reactions encompass both symptoms
- some ADRs can be dose-related or formulations-related (aim is to investigate the relationships 
between ADRs and drugs via computational tools e.g. any patterns between ADRs & drugs 
so dose/formulations-related ADRS will not be recorded/compiled here e.g. injection site irritations)
- ws = withdrawal symptoms
- ADH = antidiuretic hormone

**need to remove enters/new lines when data compilation finishes (so that column 4 will have all ADRs - currently
ADRs are entered in separate lines in order to read/check them easily)**
