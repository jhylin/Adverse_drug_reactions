#### **Adverse drug reactions** (ADRs)

ADRs data collection for CYP3A4 substrates has been completed. Potentially, more data can be collected on other different CYP substrates in the future.

Drafts of documents:

0_Ideas.qmd - the very early brainstorming of ideas for this project with some background information

1_ADR_data.qmd - all notes on ADRs and also a list of reference sources for the ADRs data

2_ADR_test.ipynb - current work-in-progress notebook trying to build a simple deep neural network (DNN) model to predict therapeutic drug classes for CYP3A4 substrates (which are also drugs)

Other files:

- A few different Python scripts for use in the notebook (to be explained later)
- A few different .tsv/.csv files of CYP3A4 substrates data or the SMILES of these substrates (to be explained later)

This work can be read in conjunction with the previous "[cytochrome P450 and small drug molecules](https://jhylin.github.io/Data_in_life_blog/posts/20_Cyp3a4_2d6_inh/1_CYP450_drugs.html)" post as it is a continuation of this project.
