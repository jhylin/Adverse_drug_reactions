##### Adverse drug reactions (ADRs)

Compiling or curating data on ADRs currently, along with some brainstorming ideas (as in "Ideas.qmd") which may lead to the use of deep learning in the end... this is likely another data exploratory and also deep learning piece...

Current data sources for ADRs:

* 1st line - drugs.com (which cites drug information from FDA, American Hospital Formulary Service Drug Information and also pharmaceutical manufacturers' data sheets)

* 2nd line - as a data check using either NZ formulary (where available), electronic medicines compendium (UK drug reference) or Drugs@FDA (US drug reference)
